#### Logic Gates
To simulate building a computer, we used CEDAR Logic Simulator. The computer is built utilizing logic gates and common components. Checkout full_computer.cdl

#### Assembly
This course taught me about NASM 32 and 64 bit assembly. Programs I built: miles per gallon calculator, a plotter, guessing game, looper, prompter, input reader, and a hello program in 32/64 bits. Additionally, we learned how to view the assembly code of a compiled C or C++ binary executable.
